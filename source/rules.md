# Rules – Spring 2020


## Registration

1. Registration ends **Sunday, January 19** at the end of the first week of classes. 
1. Teams where all members are new to Race On must register online and pay **$250 materials fee** for the cat kit.
1. Teams where one or more team members competed in a previous Race On competition still have to register online but do not pay the materials fee. We encourage teams to reuse previously received cars and we can help replace certain components.
1. Teams are formed of two to four students that are currently enrolled at USC and are the only ones who build, program, and race the car.
1. Each team delegates a contact person that will represent the team.
1. All teams compete in the same races and on the same racing track irrespective of their program and year of study.
1. Students are required to exhibit appropriate sportsmanship behavior and any attempts of cheating would result in penalties or disqualification.


## Races

1. Race On competition consists of three races.
1. Participation in all three races is mandatory for all teams.
1. Team are awarded points based on their performance in each race.
1. In Race 0, scheduled for February 1, teams will race on a simple loop track. The goal of this race is to stimulate teams to finish assembling their cars.
1. In Race 1, scheduled for March 7, teams will race on a more complex track and will be awarded points for both, participation and ranking.
1. In Race 2, the final race is scheduled for April 17, teams will race on a longer and more complex track. Team will receive points for completing a lap and the ranking points will be double compared to the first race.


## Points

*The point system is designed such that a team that did average in the first race can still win the competition if they improve for the second race. Also, the best team in the first race does not automatically win if they do average in the second race.*

1. In all three races teams will be awarded run, lap, and ranking points.
1. Run points will be awarded in Race 0 and Race 1. Teams that manage to run their car, car moves autonomously on the track, will receive 2 points.
1. Lap points will be awarded in Race 1 and Race 2. Teams that complete a lap would receive 2 points in Race 1 and 4 points in Race 2.
1. Ranking points will be awarded in Race 1 and Race 2. The top five teams that have the fastest time will be awarded ranking points based on the table below. The ranking points of Race 2 are double of the ones from Race 1.
1. The team score is the sum of the points accumulated in the two races.
1. This final score will be compared against the final score of all the teams to determine the final ranking.
1. The team with the most points wins.
1. If multiple teams have the same number of points, they will receive the same ranking. (For example, if there are 7 teams and their points are 25, 20, 20, 17, 13, 13, 10, there will be two second place winners and two fourth place winners.)
