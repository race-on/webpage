## Registration

1. Registration for the Spring 2020 edition is open until **Sunday, January 19**. 
1. Teams that register must pay **$250 materials fee** if all members are new to Race On. Teams where one or more team members competed in a previous Race On competition still have to register online but do not pay the materials fee. We encourage teams to reuse previously received cars and we can help replace certain components.
1. Teams are formed of two to four students that are currently enrolled at USC and are the only ones who build, program, and race the car.
1. Each team delegates a contact person that will represent the team.
1. All teams compete in the same races and on the same racing track irrespective of their program and year of study.
1. Students are required to exhibit appropriate sportsmanship behavior and any attempts of cheating would result in penalties or disqualification.


## Races

1. Race On competition consists of three races with mandatory participation.

	|        | **Date**              | **Room**|
	|--------|-----------------------|:-------:|
	| Race 0 | Saturday, February 8  | EEB 132 |
	| Race 1 | Saturday, February 29 | EEB 132 |
	| Race 2 | Friday, April 17      | EEB 132 |

1. Teams are awarded points based on their performance in each race.
1. In Race 0, teams will race on a simple loop track. The goal of this race is to stimulate teams to finish assembling their cars.
1. In Race 1, teams will race on an average complexity track and will be awarded points for both participation and ranking.
1. In Race 2 teams will race on a longer and more complex track. Teams will receive points for completing a lap and the ranking points will be double compared to the first race.


## Points

!!! note
        The point system is designed such that a team that did average in Race 1 can still win the competition if they improve for Race 2. The best team from Race 1 does not automatically win if they do average in Race 2. However, winning Race 1 helps break some ties in the final standings.


1. In all three races, teams will be awarded points for running the car, finishing a lap, and ranking in the top five in each race.

	|        | **Race 0** | **Race 1** | **Race 2** |
	|--------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
	| Run    |      2     |      2     |      -     |
	| Lap    |      -     |      2     |      4     |
	| Rank 1 |      -     |     10     |     20     |
	| Rank 2 |      -     |      8     |     16     |
	| Rank 3 |      -     |      6     |     12     |
	| Rank 4 |      -     |      4     |      8     |
	| Rank 5 |      -     |      2     |      4     |

1. Run points will be awarded in Race 0 and Race 1. Teams that manage to run their car, car moves autonomously on the track, will receive 2 points.
1. Lap points will be awarded in Race 1 and Race 2. Teams that complete a lap would receive 2 points in Race 1 and 4 points in Race 2.
1. Ranking points will be awarded in Race 1 and Race 2. The top five teams that have the fastest time will be awarded ranking points based on the table below. The ranking points of Race 2 are double of the ones from Race 1.
1. The team score is the sum of the points accumulated in all the races.
1. This final score will be compared against the final score of all the teams to determine the final ranking.
1. The team with the most points wins.
1. If multiple teams have the same number of points, they will receive the same ranking.


!!! example
    Team 1 manages to assemble the car for Race 0 and run it on the track. In Race 1, the team runs the car but does not complete a lap, and in Race 2, the team finishes the lap and it is the fastest lap of all teams. As a result, Team 1 will receive 28 points: 2 points for running the car in Race 0, plus 2 points for running the car in Race 1, plus 4 points for finishing a lap in Race 2, and 20 points for ranking first in Race 2.

    Team 2 does not manage to assemble the car for Race 0. In Race 1 they finish a lap and rank third and in Race 2 the car runs on the track but does not complete a lap. As a result, team 2 will receive 10 points: 2 points for running the car in Race 1, plus 2 points for finishing a lap in Race 1, and 6 points for ranking third in Race 1.


## Awards

1. Teams that competed before in Race On are allowed to switch to Jetson Nano once they earn 2 or more points.
1. Teams that accumulate 4 points or more by the end of Race 1 will receive encoders and an inertial measurement unit as an award.
1. At the end of the competition, after Race 2, teams will be awarded an Amazon gift card in the value of $10 for each accumulated point.


## Car Kit

1. All teams compete with a car built around a 1/10 scale RC touring chassis.
1. Distance between the front and back wheels, wheelbase, should be between 250 mm to 270 mm.
1. Altering the contact surface of the tires is not allowed. Changing the tires to similar ones but with a different pattern is allowed.
1. Cars should use one Mabuchi RS-540SH brushed motor to drive the car.
1. Cars should use one battery, two LiPo cells with 7.4 V nominal and 8.4 V max, to power the car and the electronics.
